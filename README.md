## Spanish Playing Cards
This project is a console application that attempts to recreate the popular blackjack variant known as [Siete y Medio]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sette_e_mezzo ).

### The Deck
#### Suits
* Oros (Diamonds)
* Copas (Hearts)
* Espadas (Spades)
* Bastos (Clubs)
#### Card Values
AS = 1 , DOS = 2, TRES = 3, CUATRO = 4, CINCO = 5, SEIS = 6, SIETE = 7, SOTA = 1/2, CABALLO = 1/2, REY = 1/2

### The Game
The game is typically played with two or more players. In this application, there are only two: the *user* and the *dealer*. The *user* starts with a total of $100 and places a bet against the *dealer*. After this initial setup, the game and rules are essentially the same as Blackjack, but instead of aiming for a score of 21, the value to reach is 7.5 without going over.
